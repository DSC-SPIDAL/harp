# THIRD_PARTY

These are some third party libraries required by harp or harp application examples.

fastutil jar is required by harp. Users need to copy this jar file with harp jar file to $HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/ directory

log4j jar is required by harp non-hadoop mode.

javaml jar is required by harp-tutorial-app randomforest example. We didn't find maven repository for it from online. So we need to manually add this third party jar to maven repository
